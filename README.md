# Wage-Determinants-Uncovering-the-Factors-that-Drive-Income

# Description
This project analyzes the Panel Study of Income Dynamics dataset (USA 1980-81) to explore the differences in hourly wages between males and females. The analysis includes converting wages from cents to dollars, performing unpaired t-tests to compare male-female hourly wages, and conducting paired t-tests to compare wage differences between 1980 and 1981. The project aims to determine if there are significant wage disparities based on gender and across the two years.
The project analyzes PSID_14 dataset to understand wages' relationship with variables like weeks worked, experience, and education. It uses natural log regression and dummy variables to identify key wage influences.

# # Panel Study of Income Dynamics Analysis and PSID_14 Regression Analysis
This repository contains two projects that analyze income dynamics and wage determinants using R.

This project analyzes the Panel Study of Income Dynamics dataset (USA 1980-81) to explore the differences in hourly wages between males and females. The analysis includes:
* Converting wages from cents to dollars
* Performing unpaired t-tests to compare male-female hourly wages
* Conducting paired t-tests to compare wage differences between 1980 and 1981
## Regression Analysis
* Performing natural log regression to understand the impact of these variables on wages
* Exploring the use of dummy variables to handle categorical variables in the regression analysis


**Key Findings:**
1. There was a significant difference in hourly wages between males and females in the PSID dataset, with males earning significantly more than females.    
2. There was no significant difference in hourly wages between 1980 and 1981 for the same individuals.  
3. Education and experience had statistically significant positive effects on wages in the PSID_14 dataset.    
4. The number of weeks worked did not have a statistically significant effect on wages.    
5. Occupation type had a significant effect on wages, with certain occupations earning significantly more than others.
